## Description
Rest API for car rental app.  
CRUD operations for Transactions, Cars and Clients.

Brief comment on business logic:  
Transactions are recorded based on the entry/exit of cars.  
When a car and a customer exit, both resources are flagged with a boolean (is_rented, is_renting) to disable them for future transactions until the ongoing transaction is completed, and then they are re-enabled. 

It doesn't align with calendar-based planning and/or combinatorial booking/logic of reservations/dates.  
It's designed to function in real-time within the office.  

It's similar to the check-in/check-out process of items from a warehouse.  
Clients can only rent one car at a time.

## Techs used
- Nest.js
- Prisma as ORM
- Cloud Postgres db in Supabase for the live version
- Local db instance with Docker to run locally and to run e2e tests

## Live deploys to see UI and interaction:
- Frontend: https://frontend-car-rental-ivory.vercel.app/
- API: https://car-rental-api.adaptable.app/api/clients

(Obs: The free tier goes to sleep after a while, and the first load may take a few seconds.)

## Running locally
You need to have installed Docker, to run a local postgres database
```bash
# clone repo and install dependencies
$ git clone --single-branch --branch development https://github.com/nico-bt/backend-car-rental-API.git
$ npm install

# Start local database with docker
$ npm run db:start

# Start the app
$ npm run start:dev

# Once you finish, to put down container:
# (will terminate both dev and test databases)
$ docker compose down
```

## Tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
# You need the local database running of the previous step
# If it is running do nothing, else run "npm run db:start" first
$ npm run test:e2e
```
